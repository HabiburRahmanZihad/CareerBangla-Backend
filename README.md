# CareerBangla Backend

The backend of **CareerBangla** is a job portal platform built with **Node.js, Express.js, Prisma ORM, and PostgreSQL**. It provides REST APIs for authentication, job management, application management, resume/ATS profiles, a coin-based credit system, subscription plans, coupons/gift vouchers, and admin control.

## Key Features & Workflows

### 1. Recruiter Approval Workflow

```
Register as Recruiter → Status: PENDING → Admin reviews → APPROVED / REJECTED
```

- Recruiters register and start in `PENDING` status
- Admin can approve (`PATCH /recruiters/approve/:id`) or reject (`PATCH /recruiters/reject/:id`)
- **Only APPROVED recruiters can post jobs** — attempting to post with PENDING/REJECTED status returns 403
- Email + in-app notifications are sent on approval/rejection

### 2. Profile Completion Requirement

- Users **must complete their ATS resume** before applying to any job
- The system checks for resume existence and that `skills` array is non-empty
- Without a completed resume, the apply endpoint returns 400 with a descriptive message

### 3. Application Status Lifecycle

```
PENDING → SHORTLISTED → INTERVIEW → HIRED
   └─────────┴──────────────┴─────→ REJECTED
```

- Status transitions are **strictly validated** — invalid transitions (e.g., HIRED → PENDING) are rejected
- Each transition triggers:
  - In-app notification to the applicant
  - Email notification with status-specific message
  - Interview date/note tracking for INTERVIEW status

### 4. Coin-Based Credit System

| Action | Coins | Role |
|--------|-------|------|
| Apply for a Job | 10 | User |
| View Recruiter Email | 15 | User |
| Post a Job | 15 | Recruiter |
| View Candidate Resume | 10 | Recruiter |

- All coin deductions happen inside **database transactions** (atomic with the action)
- Each deduction creates a `CoinTransaction` record and an in-app `COIN_DEBITED` notification
- Insufficient balance returns 400 before the action is attempted

### 5. Candidate Search (Recruiter)

`GET /api/v1/resumes/search-candidates`

| Query Param | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `searchTerm` | Free text search across title, summary, address, skills |
| `skills` | Comma-separated skill filter (e.g., `React,Node.js`) |
| `location` | Address-based location filter |
| `experience` | Filter for candidates with work experience |
| `education` | Filter for candidates with education entries |
| `page`, `limit` | Pagination |

### 6. Gift Voucher & Coupon Rules

- **maxUsage** — configurable usage limit per voucher/coupon (default: 1, supports multi-use)
- **usageCount** — tracks how many times redeemed; auto-marks as `USED` when limit reached
- **expiresAt** — expiry date; auto-marks as `EXPIRED` when redeemed after expiry
- **recipientEmail** — gift vouchers can be targeted to specific users
- Redemption credits coins to wallet within a transaction

### 7. Job Search Filters

`GET /api/v1/jobs`

| Query Param | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `searchTerm` | Search across title, description, location, company, category |
| `jobType` | FULL_TIME, PART_TIME, CONTRACT, INTERNSHIP, REMOTE |
| `location` | Filter by location |
| `categoryId` | Filter by job category |
| `experience` | Filter by experience level |
| `education` | Filter by education requirement |
| `salaryMin[gte]` | Minimum salary filter |
| `salaryMax[lte]` | Maximum salary filter |
| `sortBy`, `sortOrder` | Sorting |
| `page`, `limit` | Pagination |

### 8. Notification System (Email + In-App)

**In-app notifications** are created for:
- Application submitted (to recruiter)
- Application status changes (to applicant)
- Coin credited/debited
- Recruiter approved/rejected
- Job posted
- Subscription purchase

**Email notifications** are sent for:
- Application submitted
- Application status changes (shortlisted, interview, hired, rejected)
- Recruiter account approved/rejected
- Email verification OTP
- Password reset OTP

## Audit Notes & Known Gaps

The following items were identified during a code audit and are not yet implemented:

### Missing Features
- **Profile completion percentage check** — Users should not be able to apply for jobs until `profileCompletion === 100%`. Currently only resume existence and skills presence are validated.
- **Recruiter profile completion check** — Recruiters should not be able to post jobs until `profileCompletion === 100%` AND admin verification. Currently only admin verification (`APPROVED` status) is checked.
- **ATS score endpoint** — No ATS score calculation or endpoint exists (`POST /resumes/ats-score`).
- **Subscription cancellation** — No cancel endpoint exists.
- **Welcome notification on registration** — `registerUser()` does not create a welcome notification.

### Logic Issues
- **Coin deduction before data validation** in `getResumeByUserId` — Recruiter coins are deducted before verifying the resume exists. If resume is not found, coins are lost.
- **checkAuth middleware redundancy** — Dead code at lines 71-78 where access token is checked inside the session block but never used.
- **Potential session/JWT identity mismatch** — `req.user` is set from session data, but role is also checked from JWT. Stale JWT tokens may cause inconsistencies.

### Security Recommendations
- Add rate limiting on auth endpoints (login, register, forgot-password)
- Add CSRF protection or use `sameSite: "strict"` cookies
- Add Zod validation schema for resume update endpoint
- Remove `console.log` / `console.error` from production code
- Add proper logging library (e.g., winston, pino)
